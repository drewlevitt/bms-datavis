Option 1- Market Street

[Option 1 cross-section]

This option improves Market Streetâ€™s curbside lane using striping, sharrows and other enhancements. Bicycles, transit and vehicles share the outside lanes, with transit only center lanes. The majority of the curb remains in the existing location.

Street Life:
This option requires narrowing of the sidewalk only where new boarding islands are located, retaining plenty of opportunities for Streetlife Hubs, street furnishings, sidewalk greening, stormwater infiltration zones and cultural activities. [Streetlife Hub image]

Pedestrians:
Retaining most of the existing sidewalk space preserves the spacious pedestrian throughway. Improvements for pedestrian comfort and safety include sidewalk widening, the redesign of north side crosswalks to align with desire lines, and traffic signal improvements.

Auto Restrictions:
Due to the shared bicycle / vehicular lane east of 8th Street, auto restrictions are recommended 7am to 7pm from Fremont Street to 8th Street to accommodate peak transit flow from the Transbay Terminal to 5th Street. [Option 1 restrictions image]

Bicycle:
The existing cycletrack from Octavia to 8th Street remains with an improved supersharrow shared lane from 8th Street to Steuart Street. Intersection and traffic-signal improvements help to make the cycle facility safer and more comfortable. [Shared Lane rendering] []
