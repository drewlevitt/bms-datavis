Option 1 - Market Street

[Option 1 cross-section]

This option improves Market Street’s curbside lane using striping, sharrows and other enhancements. Bicycles, transit and vehicles share the outside lanes, with transit only center lanes. The majority of the curb remains in the existing location.

Street Life:
This option requires narrowing of the sidewalk only where new boarding islands are located, retaining plenty of opportunities for Streetlife Hubs, street furnishings, sidewalk greening, stormwater infiltration zones and cultural activities. [Streetlife Hub image]

Pedestrians:
Retaining most of the existing sidewalk space preserves the spacious pedestrian throughway. Improvements for pedestrian comfort and safety include sidewalk widening, the redesign of north side crosswalks to align with desire lines, and traffic signal improvements.

Auto Restrictions:
Due to the shared bicycle / vehicular lane east of 8th Street, auto restrictions are recommended 7am to 7pm from Fremont Street to 8th Street to accommodate peak transit flow from the Transbay Terminal to 5th Street. [Option 1 restrictions image]

Bicycle:
The existing cycletrack from Octavia to 8th Street remains with an improved supersharrow shared lane from 8th Street to Steuart Street. Intersection and traffic-signal improvements help to make the cycle facility safer and more comfortable. [Shared Lane rendering] [Option 1 bike circulation map]

Transit:
This option retains four vehicular travel lanes and transit only center lanes. Boarding islands are upgraded to meet accessibility standards and improve the experience of waiting for transit. Intersection improvements, transit stop consolidation, service changes and auto restrictions result in varying percentages of faster service. [Option 1 Transit Scenario Comparison chart]

Option 2 - Market Street

[Option 2 cross-section]

This option proposes a one-way cycletrack on Market Street in each direction from Steuart Street to Grant Street and 5th Street to Octavia Boulevard. Four lanes for transit and vehicles remain with transit only center lanes. The curb moves to accommodate the cycletrack, reducing the Streelife Zone area.

Street Life:
The cycletrack creates opportunities for cyclists to engage in street life. This option requires significant narrowing of the sidewalk, leaving less room for street life opportunities. [Streetlife Zone image]

Pedestrians:
The cycletrack buffers pedestrians from vehicular traffic. The redesign of north side crosswalks to align with desire lines and traffic signal improvements improve pedestrian comfort and safety.

Auto Restrictions:
Due to the shared bicycle / vehicular lane from Grant Street to 5th Street, auto restrictions are recommended 7am to 7pm from Fremont Street to 5th Street to accomodate peak transit flow on Market Street from the Transbay Terminal to 5th Street. [Option 2 restrictions image]

Bicycle:
The cycletrack from Steuart Street to Grant Street and 5th Street to Octavia Boulevard provides a safe, comfortable cycling experience. Intersection and traffic-signal improvements also help to make the cycle facility more legible. [Cycletrack rendering] [Option 2 bike circulation map]

Transit:
The separated bicycle facility reduces bike – transit conflicts. This option retains four vehicular travel lanes and transit only center lanes. Boarding islands are upgraded to meet accessibility standards and improve the experience of waiting for transit. Intersection improvements, transit stop consolidation, service changes and auto restrictions result in varying percentages of faster service. [Option 2 Transit Scenario Comparison chart]

Option 3 - Mission Street + Market Street

Mission Street improvements in combination with Option 1 - Market Street [Mission St section]

This option proposes a one-way, buffered cycletrack on Mission Street in each direction. All transit moves from Mission Street to Market Street and two lanes of vehicular traffic remain on Mission Street. Pedestrians benefit from street life improvements on both Market and Mission Streets. <i>(For Market Street elements see Option 1)</i>

Street Life:
This option invites a vision for an integrated district, connecting Market Street to SoMa and activating the network of streets and alleys in between. The cycletrack allows cyclists to engage in streetlife. [Mission St Streetlife Zone rendering]

Pedestrians:
The cycletrack provides a buffer for pedestrians from vehicular traffic. This option provides opportunity to insert additional mid-block signalized crosswalks on Mission Street and widen the sidewalk in the active blocks of 1st to 2nd Street and 3rd to 4th Street.

Auto Restrictions (on Market Street):
Due to the shared bicycle / vehicular lane east of 8th Street and the rerouting of buses from Mission Street, maximum auto restrictions are recommended 7am to 7pm from Fremont Street to Van Ness Avenue. New left turns in this option help facilitate traffic crossing Market Street. [Option 3 restrictions image]

Bicycle:
This option proposes a buffered cycletrack on Mission Street from South Van Ness to the Embarcadero, with greenwave signal timing (synchronized lights for bicycles). There is an opportunity to create new cycle connections to/from Valencia and the Wiggle and between Market Street and Mission Street. The perpendicular intersections and absence of F-line tracks or BART grates on Mission Street allow for safe travel and comfortable left turns. [Cycletrack photo] [Option 3 bike circulation map]

Transit:
In this option the 14/14L, Golden Gate Transit and SamTrans bus lines move to Market Street. This proposal requires making Market Street the transit priority corridor. Bicycles and automobiles would primarily use Mission Street. [Option 3 Transit Scenario Comparison chart]
